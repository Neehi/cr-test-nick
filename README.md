# Clear Review technical test

The test is to create a small web based app that uses an Django Rest Framework API and Angular. There are requirements below. Regularly commit to the repo and write tests. 

## Requirements

Produce a web application with a backend API that will take a sentence, splits it into whole words and store the words in a database. The web application must then be able to list all the unique words and how many times they appear in the database. Add a input box that a user can enter words that will filter the list. The filter does not have to match the whole word. Highlight in the word where the search matches. Style the web application to look nice. Document in this README how to run the appliction.
